# Data-Structures-and-Algorithum

In this Repository I will upload Data structures, Algorithms and I will also explains the BIG O Complexity regarding each algorithum.

## LINKED LISTS :- 

Linked list is a data structure similar to array in a sense that it stores bunch of items. But unlike array, linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations. They are instead chained by an element storing address location of next element. This makes insertion very easy. Also unlike dynamic arrays you don't have to pre-allocate some memory capacity.

Advantage : 1) We don't need to pre allocate space.
            2) Insertion is easier.
            
BIG O complexities :- 

- Insert element at beginning = O(1)
- Delete element at beginning = O(1)
- Insert element at end = O(n)
- Delete element at end = O(n)
- Linked List Transversal = O(n)
- Access element by Value = O(n)
